Exercise 3: Slicing\n","\n","Slicing uses the [] operator to select a set of rows and/or columns from a DataFrame.\n","\n","To slice out a set of rows, you use this syntax: data[start:stop], \n","\n","here the start represents the index from where to consider, and stop represents the index one step BEYOND the row you want to select. You can perform slicing using both the index and the name of the column.\n","\n","> NOTE: When slicing in pandas, the start bound is included in the output.\n","\n","So if you want to select rows 0, 1, and 2 your code would look like this: df.iloc[0:3].\n","\n","It means you are telling Python to start at index 0 and select rows 0, 1, 2 up to but not including 3.\n","\n","> NOTE: Labels must be found in the DataFrame or you will get a KeyError.\n","\n","Indexing by labels(i.e. using <code>loc()</code>) differs from indexing by integers (i.e. using <code>iloc()</code>). With <code>loc()</code>, both the start bound and the stop bound are inclusive. When using <code>loc()</code>, integers can be used, but the integers refer to the index label and not the position. \n","\n","For example, using <code>loc()</code> and select 1:4 will get a different result than using <code>iloc()</code> to select rows 1:4.\n","\n","<h4 id=\"data\">We can also select a specific data value using a row and column location within the DataFrame and iloc
